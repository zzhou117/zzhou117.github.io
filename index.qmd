I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Health Services, Policy & Practice at the Brown University School of Public Health.

My research interests include value-based payment to better align provider reimbursement with improved quality and reduced cost, innovative health insurance design, payment policy, and healthcare reforms.

Please feel free to get in touch!
